    review:
      The French and Italian-inspired small plates won't blow your mind, but
      Zinque's openness and windowed atmosphere are hard to deny. Catch the
      cross breeze with a draft Delirium Tremens.

    review:
      Pushing the tapas game forward. Inventive, fine combinations of food
      flavors, such as subtle uni & burrata (pictured), buttery shrimp toast,
      and a surprising fried chicken sandwich. Also a deference to craft
      cocktails.

    review:
      The most balanced sushi restaurant on the west side. Traditional style
      sushi with many adventurous (to the American palate) daily specials, and
      a comforting hot food menu to boot. If you can't decide between fine
      sushi and fried chicken, they do them both. Yabu isn't cheap, but isn't
      expensive either.

    review:
      Some say it's high priced for what it is. For breakfast, eggs, plantains,
      toast, passionfruit juice. For lunch, grilled meat, rice, beans, and
      salsa. However the sauce is so succulent. Maybe if they sold their
      sauces, I'd buy them and cook the rest at home. Then I'd be missing on
      the breezy, plant-canopied patio.

    review:
      The best breakfast sandwiches on the west side are Earl's popeye and
      croque madame. Nothing else too intense here. Which is welcome in the
      otherwise high-caloric gourmet sandwich industry. Rather, Earl's
      ingredients are inventive but subtle. The staff is passionate to deliver
      you a fine meal, and tell an absurd joke on their marquee.

    review:
      America's best ramen. It's so good that everyday it has the only line out
      the door, despite 5 other ramen restaurants within 2 blocks. It's so good
      that guests flip a table when they return for dinner, only to find a
      completely different Japanese cuisine, sans the ramen. It's worth the
      lunch trip alone. However the dinner is consistent and exquisite, an
      excellent date excursion. Try the ox tongue steak and swallow-delaying
      kakuni.

    review:
      Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey. Impress your friends by discussing their
      incredible selection. Maybe go all out on an educational whiskey flight.
      Their Makers Mark sours however are streamlined and consistent, a good
      starting point and return point. The venue can get pretty crowded, but
      BYOF is an option.

    review:
      Surprisingly advanced food at the gateway to the marijuana card-pushing
      Venice beach. The green curry mussels are a requirement. With a good
      draft beer selection, sunshine pouring in, and all the patrons smiling,
      it keeps the beach's vibe. It's a Venice institution. You'll forgive the
      wait for the bathroom.
