      The French and Italian-inspired small plates won't blow your mind, but
      Zinque's openness and windowed atmosphere are hard to deny. Catch the
      cross breeze with a draft Delirium Tremens.

      Pushing the tapas game forward. Inventive, fine combinations of food
      flavors, such as subtle uni & burrata (pictured), buttery shrimp toast,
      and a surprising fried chicken sandwich. Also a deference to craft,
      seasonal cocktails.

    review:
      The most balanced sushi restaurant on the west side. Traditional style
      sushi with many adventurous (to the American palate) daily specials, and
      a comforting hot food menu to boot. If you can't decide between fine
      sushi and fried chicken, they do them both. Yabu isn't cheap (good sushi
      never is), but isn't expensive, sushi nazi level either.

    review:
      Some say it's high priced for what it is. For breakfast, eggs, plantains,
      toast, passionfruit juice. For lunch, grilled meat, rice, beans, and
      salsa. However the sauce is so succulent. Maybe if they sold their
      sauces, I'd buy them and cook the rest at home. Then I'd be missing on
      the breezy, plant-canopied patio.

      The best breakfast sandwiches on the west side are Earl's popeye and
      croque madame. Nothing else too intense here. Which is welcome in the
      otherwise high-caloric gourmet sandwich industry. Rather, Earl's
      ingredients are inventive but subtle. The staff is passionate to deliver
      you a fine meal, and tell an absurd joke on their marquee.

    review:
      America's best ramen. It's so good that everyday throughout lunch Tsujita
      has the only line out the door, despite 5 other ramen restaurants within
      2 blocks, in this West LA Japan town (Little Osaka). It's so good that
      guests get angry when they return for dinner, only to find a completely
      different Japanese cuisine sans ramen. It's worth the lunch trip alone.
      However the dinner is consistent and exquisite, an excellent date
      excursion. Try the ox tongue steak and swallow-delaying kakuni.

      They've cornered the ramen market with a 2nd location directly across
      from their original, which serves a different style of ramen and at
      dinner. It's worth a taste test, but the original location's flagship
      ramen is still the best.

      A little far to travel to call West LA maybe, but you'll soon find why
      this remote fish shack in Malibu always has a line out the door. The west
      coast's best fish and chips. Make sure you have enough extra bread to dip
      in the clam broth.

      A Los Angeles bastion of organic, proud coffee. Their portions are
      generous and put together. If only the line to order wasn't always so
      long, and the subsequent search for a table so stressful. I recommend
      ordering ahead for pickup. Try the chicken curry sandwich and a Spanish
      latte.

      Welcome brunch-oriented, fine dining. The sundried-tomato and chorizo
      mussels are a certified gold combination. I like Roscoe's, but this place
      seems to hold its own with chicken and waffles. They boast a few
      quirkily-named cocktails. The one you want is the Vatican Assassin, a
      maple-y take on a Gold Rush.

    review:
      Santa Monica's king of tapas, finely spiced. The calamari with swiss
      chard is a certified gold combination. There are some bizarre pizza
      toppings, but with so many options, you'll find a combo right for your
      group.  The pasta portions are small, but the quality is so
      disproportionately high, it doesn't matter. As far as drinks, consider
      asking them to swap out the bourbon in the Dotto (their version of a Gold
      Rush) for scotch.

    review:
      A more modern, less pretentious spin on the retro craft cocktail bar.
      Plays amplifying, feel-good hip-hop. And they weren't afraid to continue
      down the sports bar route with a couple big screens. The drink names and
      ingredients are special, but won't make your head spin.  Try their house
      G&T for example.  Excellent kitchen. Try the smoked potatoes and steak
      sandwich.

      Used to be open for Sunday brunch. With the windows open and football
      game on, it was heavenly. Let's hope they bring it back.

      Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey. Impress your friends by discussing their
      incredible selection. Maybe go all out on an educational whiskey flight.
      Their Makers Mark sours however are streamlined and consistent, a good
      starting point and return point. The venue can get pretty crowded. If
      it's not, BYOF is an option.

      The crowd here is torn between the admittedly pricey cocktails and the
      more mainstream Bigfoot West a block away. However if you appreciate
      craft cocktails, backed by a focused liquor selection, fresh and organic
      juices, retro garb, and white tile decor, Oldfield's delivers. Let them
      find a drink that's right for you.

      I like a good hole-in-the-wall Vietnamese restaurant. Sometimes the
      unclean joints taste the best. But if you don't mind a little class,
      Nongla delivers Vietnamese pedestrian food with finesse, without breaking
      the bank.

      Sugarfish is your ideal sushi destination if don't like making decisions.
      Their omikase-preferred approach won't ever disappoint, unless you second
      guess and choose too small a portion. The courses are ordered and sauced
      simply and sublimely.

    review:
      Usually a giant, diverse menu is a bad sign the restaurant needs to focus
      its offerings. Not so at Marla's. They deftly handle sandwiches, ribs,
      fish, Mexican, and sweets, in generous portions. The servers are
      especially kind, interestingly eschewing small talk to instead
      self-promote the quality of their preparation. If pride is wrong, then I
      don't want them to be right.

      -1 service point however because of their irregular restaurant hours,
      which has marred my repeat business. Unfortunately they seem to be a
      catering company first, resaurant second.

      I'm a sucker for German and Belgian beer--really the finest countries in
      that game. This Los Angeles up-and-comer combines an impressive beer
      collection with high quality Belgian-style frites, sausages with
      authentic toppings, and beer-garden style indoor seating. The exotic
      sausages in particular are worth your taste buds' while, like the peppery
      rattlesnake sausage. Add a DJ, paper tablecloths, and crayons, and these
      guys know how to party.

      Surprisingly advanced food at the gateway to the marijuana card-pushing
      Venice beach. The green curry mussels are a requirement. With a good
      draft beer selection, sunshine pouring in, and all the patrons smiling,
      it keeps the beach's vibe. It's a Venice institution. You'll forgive the
      wait for the bathroom.
